# Education and other activities

This page details my education and other activities.

## North Carolina State University - Bachelor of Arts: English - Letters, Writing and Rhetoric

I graduated from North Carolina State University's English program magna cum laude. 

Letters, Writing, and Rhetoric is a concentration that focuses on written English in its theoretical, cultural, and practical applications. Many students who graduated in this concentration went on to journalism and business writing positions. Since I graduated, the concentration has been renamed Rhetoric and Professional Writing. 

My overall GPA was 3.8. Within my major, my GPA was a 4.0.

### WKNC

While at NC State, I volunteered at the college radio station, WKNC. At first I only deejayed and helped operate the board during baseball games, but eventually I learned how to edit and record audio. Because of this, I landed a more permanent position at the station as a Production Manager, where I recorded donor announcements and public service announcements and edited the Eye on the Triangle podcast.

## Volunteering

I enjoy getting involved in my local community, and have volunteered with multiple organizations throughout the years.

### Diaper Bank of North Carolina

When I worked at Dell, I was introduced to the Diaper Bank of NC through our internal Gives Back program. My first volunteer experience was so positive, that I quickly became an ambassador for the Diaper Bank, organizing diaper drives and volunteer events with them regularly.

Since being laid off in early 2024, I have spent more time volunteering at the Diaper Bank. I try to go at least once a week as a way to put my extra time to good use.

## Pride employee resource group (ERG)

During my time at both Dell and VMware, I was heavily involved with the Pride employee resource group to help LGBTQIA+ employees feel welcome and supported at work. 

### VMware

Communications co-lead for VMware employee resource group.

One of the biggest deliverables I worked on for the VMware Pride group was an Executive Sponsor Playbook. This playbook explained what an executive sponsor is, who is eligible to be an executive sponsor, and what is expected of someone in this role.

### Dell

Site lead for North Carolina for Pride employee resource group.


## Presentations and conferences

One of my passions is education, and there is no easier way to educate than to deliver presentations. I have created a number of internal and external presentations through my involvement in the Pride employee resource group at Dell. I have also spoken both in person and virtually at multiple conferences:

- Out and Equal Summit 2019 - Panelist and presenter
- Out and Equal Summit 2020 - Panelist
- VMworld 2021 - Panelist, The Tweet that Launched a Fleet of Inclusive Language
- Society for Technical Communication 2023 - Panelist, How to Cross the Street into TechComm

## Personal

I'm always looking for ways to keep my writing skills sharp, even while enjoying my hobbies. My favorite way of giving back is contributing to online strategy guides or open source strategy guide wikis so I can help guide others through my favorite games.

### StrategyWiki

While playing through older Final Fantasy games, I found myself getting stuck often, but the guides that were available online were incomplete or unclear. Starting with Final Fantasy III, I cleaned up and clarified walkthrough text.

### BGWiki

During my playthrough of Final Fantasy XI in 2020 I relied heavily on the FFXI-specific BGWiki for information and help. I found and corrected minor errors as I went through the game.
