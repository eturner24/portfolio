## Why don't I have any contributions on GitHub?

I know how it looks: you asked for my GitHub profile, but I don't have any contributions. Most of my work on GitHub is done over a private, restricted GitHub Enterprise account. This account is a personal account, so I have far fewer contributions here. Since you're here, why not take a look at my [portfolio](portfolio.md) instead?
