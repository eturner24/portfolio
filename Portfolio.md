# Portfolio

My portfolio contains a selection of the projects I have worked on during my career and the finished documentation associated with each project.

## PayPal

I was primarily an editor at PayPal, but I continued to work as a writer whenever possible to ensure I kept my writing skills up to snuff. 

### Package tracking API guide

I wrote documentation to help add the option to track packages when creating an order using the PayPal REST API. I worked collaboratively with a stakeholder from the engineering team to research this feature, understand how it works, and get the right API calls in the right order.

### Verify with PayPal

## VMware

### Savings automator

Technical documentation to accompany the savings automator feature in CloudHealth. The release of this feature was around the same time as the cost anomaly detection release, so I had to manage tight deadlines to get both done in time. Worked closely with the team developing this feature to research, draft, review, and publish documentation.

## Dell EMC

While at Dell EMC, my 2 primary products were Dell EMC Unity and PowerStore, both midrange storage offerings.

Dell EMC Unity was released in 2016, and was the first product launch I went through at Dell EMC. I worked primarily on hardware documentation for the product lifecycle, but I also worked on release notes, command-line interface documentation, service command documentation, and UnityVSA (a virtualized version of the Unity product) product documentation.

PowerStore launched in 2020 as Dell EMC's next-generation storage offering. I worked on hardware documentation for PowerStore as well, but shifted focus to other software features to ensure I didn't get too specialized as a hardware writer. I also started working on videos during the PowerStore product lifecycle, and created 6 videos to support the release.

### PowerStore and Unity Quick Start Guides

These guides are printed documents that ship with new hardware. They outline the simplest, quickest method to get the new system installed and running:
- [PowerStore Quick Start Guide](https://downloads.dell.com/manuals/common/pwrstr-qsg_en-us.pdf)
- [Unity XT Quick Start Guide](https://www.dellemc.com/en-us/collaterals/unauth/technical-guides-support-information/products/storage/docu94615.pdf)

#### PowerStore Quick Start Video

I also developed a video of the content in the Quick Start Guide. Due to COVID-19, the original plans to take video footage of an actual installation were scrapped. Instead, I created the video using animations of the graphics in the document.

### PowerStore - Protecting Your Data

This document helps a customer learn about and take advantage of data protection technologies such as replication, thin cloning, and snapshots.

#### Video: What's the Difference Between Refreshing and Restoring Snapshots?

While writing the Protecting Your Data document, I often found myself struggling to differentiate between the snapshot refresh operation and the snapshot restore operation. Sensing that our customers may struggle with this differentiation as well, I developed this video to make the distinction clear.

### PowerStore - Installation and Service Guide

Because PowerStore used brand new hardware, we needed to develop new replacement procedures to help customers install the system, or replace failed parts. I collaborated with other team members to create the Installation and Service Guide. This guide required many trips to the lab to try out and test replacement procedures, working with engineering teams to learn prerequisites for replacements, and working with an illustrator to ensure our graphics reflected the actual hardware.

### Unity XT Hardware Information Guide
This guide provides a detailed look at the Unity XT platform. Similar to the PowerStore Installation and Service Guide, this was a heavily collaborative document.
