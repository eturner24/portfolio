# Experience

I am an experienced technical content developer with nearly 9 years of experience, developing technical content such as hardware installation guides, SaaS product guides, quick start guides, user manuals, video scripts, REST API guides and GraphQL guides for tech companies.

My area of expertise is language and writing. I'm a strong writer who has been writing ever since I learned how to put a pen to paper. Combining my love of writing and technology, technical writing is a career path that I'm passionate about. In my career as a technical writer, I have specialized in crafting customer-facing documentation that helps users get started quickly and succeed.

My personal strength is building relationships. As a technical writer, I rarely just sit alone and write - I regularly need to meet with stakeholders and other team members to get information. Because these stakeholders are key to getting work done, I take the time to get to know my stakeholders, what kinds of interests they have, and how we can work best together. As a result, my connections at work help me get information from a wider variety of sources, which in turn make my documentation much more complete.

## Senior Technical Writer and Editor, PayPal Developer (September 2022 – current)

I joined PayPal as a Senior Technical Editor, excited to put my skills in tech comm to use across the entire PayPal REST API documentation portfolio. As an editor, I don't just look for typos and style issues - Grammarly can do that for us. Where I add value as an editor is looking across our documentation set and identifying ways we can connect the gaps in our documentation story. I also look for ways we can reuse content and apply smarter content strategy, just like I did when I was working at Dell.

Because my editorial duties don't take up enough time for a full time job, I also spend half my time as a technical writer, picking up any work that our other writers can't fit in. I've worked on integration guides for new features such as tracking packages and complete doc overhauls such as our getting started guide.

My favorite part of working at PayPal is the unique position I have as an editor that lets me lead the team alongside them. I have regular 1:1s with each writer on my team, and editorial office hours with the broader team to help develop writing skills. I facilitate a line of communication between my manager and my team that my writers may normally be nervous about opening, and I have been called the glue of my team for this work.

### Main responsibilities

- Write, edit, and review REST API documentation in Markdown for a developer audience.
- Developing documentation plans and schedules to align with the writing and engineering team's Agile development cycle. 
- Open and review contributor pull requests in GitHub, following a docs-as-code methodology. 
- Develop and maintain style guidelines in Confluence and conduct technical reviews for a team of 5 writers in 3 time zones on the PayPal Developer, Braintree, and Zettle product writing teams.

### Accomplishments and personal projects

- Implemented Grammarly to check content for adherence to style guide, which reduced time spent editing a document by 25-50% and helped improve consistency in tone and voice.
- Managed a documentation hack week, where I took documentation JIRA issues from teams, resolved bugs, and assigned bugs to writers. Quickly addressed over 65 bugs, diverting them from our main JIRA backlog.
- Hold weekly editorial office hours to discuss content and style questions and conduct live reviews to help writers learn and grow. Also hold weekly 1:1s to individually mentor 5 writers on my team, improve communication between my manager and my team, and foster good working relationships.
- Investigated potential solutions for a new content management system:
	- Interviewed writers to understand their current process and pain points.
	- Wrote user stories and a functional specification for tooling, including making tool recommendations like Paligo and ZoomIn.
	- Educated cross-functional stakeholders on authoring principles such as single sourcing content to help influence solutioning. 
	
## Senior Technical Writer, CloudHealth by VMware (November 2020 – September 2022)

Though I joined a large company, my time at VMware was unique in that I joined the CloudHealth team: a relatively new startup acquisition for VMware. I had never worked at a startup and so I quickly learned how much faster projects move at a startup!

My favorite project while at VMware was the project to move our CloudHealth Help Center into the main VMware documentation hub. I talked to major stakeholders at CloudHealth and convinced them of the benefits of moving into VMware's documentation hub. After I got approval, I worked with an engineer on developing a Python script to convert a JSON export of our Contentful CMS repository to Markdown files. It was challenging work, but in the end we were able to migrate cleanly and successfully, without any manual work.

I also had the opportunity to spend time working with the UX team and improve my UI writing skills. Inspired by this work, I earned a certificate in UX Writing from the [UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/) so I could ensure I followed best practices in UX writing.

### Main responsibilities

- Document the CloudHealth product platform as it was being developed by partnering closely with globally dispersed development teams to research new features, scope documentation projects, and review drafts. 
- Ran multiple documentation projects concurrently, which required managing competing priorities and multi-tasking. 
- Wrote documentation in Markdown and adhered to an Agile release schedule. 
- Maintained the Gatsby static site generator based on React and JavaScript.
- Work with UX designers to review UI messaging and alerts for new features in the CloudHealth platform.

### Accomplishments and personal projects

- Initiated and led a migration from our proprietary Markdown help center to the centralized VMware documentation platform based on Oxygen XML Editor and GitLab.
- Conduct technical reviews of peers’ documentation to ensure a unified voice.

## Technical Writer 2, Dell EMC (October 2015 - October 2020)

I started my career with EMC in 2015. Shortly after I joined, I went through the then-largest tech merger in history when Dell bought EMC. During my tenure at Dell, I learned the basics of technical communication, including content strategy, information architecture, and implementing reuse, variables, and conditioning to author content efficiently. 

My favorite part of working at Dell was working in our structured authoring environment based around DITA XML. I was always looking for ways to reuse content, which helps save time on authoring brand new docs, reduces translation costs, and keeps common content in docs consistent.

### Main responsibilities

- Wrote and edited hardware-focused technical documentation for replacement and installation procedures for Dell EMC servers, authoring topic-based content in DITA XML. 
- Created quick-start guides to help customers get set up with new servers quickly. Worked with cross-functional stakeholders to validate and review content.

### Accomplishments and personal projects

- Attended beta testing to gather customer feedback, which helped ensure the documentation is accurate, consistent, and met customer needs.
- Collaborated on new style guidelines after the merge of Dell and EMC, aligning standards and knowledge from 2 large writing teams into one resource.
- Created 6 how-to videos of top customer issues. The most popular video received nearly 20k views, with 1k of views happening in the first month of publication.
- Built and published publications in SDL Publication Manager to PDF and HTML5 online help outputs.
